/* This shader approximates the ambient occlusion in screen space (SSAO). 
 * It is based on the assumption that a pixel will be occluded by neighboring 
 * pixels iff. those have a depth value closer to the camera than the original
 * pixel itself (the function getOcclusionFactor() computes this occlusion 
 * by a single other pixel).
 *
 * A naive approach would sample all pixels within a given distance. For an
 * interesting-looking effect, the sampling area needs to be at least 9 pixels 
 * wide (-/+ 4), requiring 81 texture lookups per pixel for ambient occlusion.
 * This overburdens many GPUs.
 * To make the ambient occlusion computation faster, we employ the following 
 * tricks:
 * 1. We do not consider all texels in the sampling area, but only a select few 
 *    (at most 16). This causes some sampling artifacts, which are later
 *    removed by blurring the ambient occlusion texture (this is done in a
 *    separate shader).
 * 2. The further away an object is the fewer samples are considered and the
 *    closer are these samples to the texel for which the ambient occlusion is
 *    being computed. The rationale is that ambient occlusion attempts to de-
 *    determine occlusion by *nearby* other objects. Due to the perspective 
 *    projection, the further away objects are, the smaller they become. 
 *    So the further away objects are, the closer are those nearby other objects
 *    in screen-space, and thus texels further away no longer need to be 
 *    considered.
 *    As a positive side-effect, this also reduces the total number of texels 
 *    that need to be sampled.
